Ride share trends in urban, suburban and rural areas:

- Urban areas experience the largest number of total fares, total rides and total drivers out of the three city types, with rural areas being the smallest.

- Rural areas seem to have larger average fares than suburban and urban areas. 
One reason for this could be that rural area rides could be longer (average distance per ride would be helpful in this situation) or rideshares 
charge more out in areas that experience little activity.
Even though there are a lot more urban rides and drivers, fares are lower than suburban and rural areas because either the riders only travel a short 
distance or fares are chargedat a lower price in crowded areas.

-If you were to make a trend line for the average price per ride and the total number of rides, it
 would make (I would assume) a negative slope. The more rides, the lower the fare is. The lower the amount of rides there are, the higher the fares are.
